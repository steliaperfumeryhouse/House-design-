Create a 2D digital floor plan of a traditional Chinese family home. 
Use handwritten Chinese labels for each room, including:
- 我的家 (My Home)
- 文夫的家 (Wenfu’s Home)
- 走廊 (Corridor)
- 玻璃路 (Glass Path)
- 硬厨房 (Hard Kitchen)
- 庭院 (Garden)
- 大女儿 (Eldest Daughter)
- 小女儿 (Younger Daughter)
- 荸荠 (Water Chestnut)

Design the layout with clean black lines on a white grid background. 
Separate each space clearly with bold outlines. 
The style should be minimalist and hand-drawn, with yellow handwritten Chinese text for labels. 
Include a small illustration of traditional Chinese food (dumplings, rice cakes, pickled vegetables) in the bottom corner. 
Overall look: simple, modern, schematic, easy to read.
